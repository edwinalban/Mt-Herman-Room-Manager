# Mt-Herman-Room-Manager
App for managing the status of rooms at Mt. Herman

## Description

This is a MERN app is designed to allow an administrative user to view all of the employees, rooms, and schedules for cleaning. The admin can create an accout and log in to view all of the employees and their schedules on the landing page.

The purpose of the project is to replace a Googles Docs spreadsheet that is currently being used by the staff with an app. I was asked to convert the spreadsheet and all of it's functionality. I have used this as an opportunity to become more familiar with MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React, Node, GraphQL, and Bootstrap. I have built an API, set up the server, tested the functionality of the queries and mutations in the Apollo Sandbox and started work on the client-side rendering. It is a work-in-progress and I have learned a lot along the way.

## Usage

The project can be found here: 

A user can create an account or log in, if they already have one. The landing page shows a dashboard of all of the employees, their schedules can be viewed, and they can be removed from the database, if necessary. The navbar will route the use to the desired page. Currently, all of the rooms can be viewed and a user can choose to view the details of a room, at which point the cleaning schedules for the room can be viewed and added. Employees can be assigned to individual schedules, if desired.
